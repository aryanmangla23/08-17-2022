Kay ded day

Worked on essay + interview + revisions then biking 8 miles + working in the heat for 4 hours. 

Went home showered slept for an hour. Had no dinner or lunch watched some netflix. 

Was in a call with ffs. Then ruiqi brought up me no inviting anyone. Funny why he blames me and not other people that were also there. I live 15 minutes away and already have enough stress from convincing my parents to hang out with u guys ONCE PER WEEK. LOLL u guys live 2 minutes away figure this shit out urself. And We didnt even plan to. I went to library. Saw claire. Decided last minute to just hang out at joseph and soohyuk. Then claire had to pick up stationary so we went to west gate. She went for her shit and us 3 fooled around for 1 hour max. not even more than an hour. Then we went back and left. Literally nothin happened dat was interesting. LOL. aite defended myself. Then ruiqi said "ya cool". Then david left the call after I brought up that he went to SF with alex, soohyuk, and whoever else. Without asking any of us if we wanted to go. And they planned it a day before, which is way more time than planning in the moment which is wat happened with wat i did. aite man.

I can't imagine how peaceful HOW IT IS TO JUST FUCKING SLEEP ON A CLIFF LOOKING AT THE SKY FULL OF STARS. The last time i did that was in 8th grade. I miss that so fucking much that it pisses me off. The peaceful sound of the lake which is right below me, the crackling of a campfire, and me snuggled in my sleeing bag just mesmerized. BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Who said i want to become a doctor. Rather be a hobo and live staring at the stars in the sierra.
